## httpgd

We are splitting the `httpgd` package up into this package and the `httpgd` package.
This package has all the plotting and rendering code, and the `httpgd` package has the web-service code.

After/if this package is accepted to CRAN, we will submit the new version of the `httpgd` package to CRAN.
